      Before you can use Beta Notifications, you need to accept our data sharing and financial agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This must be done by, or on behalf of, someone with the authority to sign contracts for your organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once accepted, the agreement covers all Notify services from your organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different agreements for crown and non-crown organisations.

      <a class="fr-link" href="{{ url_for('main.support') }}">Contact us</a> to tell us
      whether or not you work for a crown organisation. If you’re not sure
      we’ll help you work it out.
