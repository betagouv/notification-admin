    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>

    <p>Beta Notifications is a service that lets public service teams in the UK send emails, text messages, and letters
      to users of their service.</p>

    <p>Beta Notifications is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part of the Cabinet Office.</p>

    <p>Organisations sending notifications using Beta Notifications are the data controller and Cabinet Office is the data processor. The data controller must tell you about what they are doing with your personal data.</p>

    <p>For the credentials used to access Beta Notifications, Cabinet Office is the data controller.</p>

    <p>For more information see the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a class="fr-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/esdwebpages/search">Data Protection Public Register</a>.
      The Cabinet Office registration number is: Z7414053</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="what-data-we-collect-from-you">What data we collect from you</h2>

    <p>The personal data we collect from public sector employees that create a Beta Notifications account includes:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>your email address</li>
        <li>your mobile phone number</li>
        <li>the IP address you use to access Beta Notifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The legal basis for processing this data is ‘public task’ – allowing you to access Beta Notifications to send notifications
      to users of your public service.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="why-we-need-your-data">Why we need your data</h2>

    <p>We need your personal data to ensure that only legitimate users of Beta Notifications can use it to send notifications.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="what-we-do-with-your-data">What we do with your data</h2>

    <p>We use your data to check that you are allowed to access Beta Notifications and to record your activity when using it. We use third party suppliers to do this.</p>

    <p>We will not:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
        <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="how-long-we-keep-your-data">How long we keep your data</h2>

    <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as you have a Beta Notifications account.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="where-your-data-is-processed">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

    <p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s
      processed and when it’s stored.</p>

    <p>Your personal data will be processed both in the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Your data receives the same level of protection in the EEA as it does in the UK through the safeguard of <a class="fr-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/adequacy/">Adequacy Decisions</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="how-we-protect-your-data">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

    <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have
      put in place technical and organisational procedures to secure the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your
      data using varying levels of encryption. We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with have an obligation to
      keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="childrens-privacy-protection">Children’s privacy protection</h2>

    <p>We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy online. Our services are not designed for, or intentionally
      targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone
      under the age of 13.</p>
